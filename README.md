# An extended-2D CNN approach for diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease through structural MRI

## Description:
This repository is a compile of my Master's thesis "An extended-2D CNN approach for diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease through structural MRI". Here I
share the scripts I had programmed to the following publications:

- Pereira, M. et al., An extended-2D CNN approach for diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease through structural MRI. In International Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (ISMRM) Annual Meeting and Exhibition 2019
- Pereira, M. et al., An extended-2D CNN for multiclass Alzheimer's Disease diagnosis through Structural MRI. In SPIE Medical Imaging 2020: Computer-Aided Diagnosis

## Requirements:
- Python 3.5.4
- Numpy 1.12.1
- Scipy 1.0.1
- Matplotlib 2.0.2
- Scikit-learn 0.19.0
- Nibabel 2.2.1
- Pytorch 1.4

## Dataset:
*Data used in preparation of this article were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (adni.loni.usc.edu). As such, the investigators within the ADNI contributed to the design and implementation of ADNI and/or provided data but did not participate in analysis or writing of this report. A complete listing of ADNI investigators can be found at: http://adni.loni.usc.edu/wp-content/uploads/how_to_apply/ADNI_Acknowledgement_List.pdf
